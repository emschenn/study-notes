> *Notes and codes for [Creative Coding Course](https://frontendmasters.com/teachers/matt-deslauriers/) taught by Matt DesLauriers at FrontendMaster.*
 
Creative coding is a different discipline than programming systems. The goal is to create something expressive instead of something functional. **Interaction design**, **information visualization** and **generative art** are all different types of creative coding â€“ which has become a household term describing artworks articulated as code.
