## JAMstack?

**J**avascript + **A**PI + **M**ockup + **Stack** (tools u can use)<br/>
👉🏼 An approach to web design that emphasizes shipping only static assets.

### Benefits

- **Reduced complexity**
  - allow us to use only a CDN, which lets us skip servers, databases, load balancers, etc.
- **Lower costs**
  - CDNs are cheap — or even free.
  - On top of that, the lowered complexity requires less time and effort spent on devops.
- **Faster shipping**
  - Fewer moving parts makes it easier to ship quickly and with confidence.
- **Increased autonomy**
  - A simplified stack means a single developer is able to take projects from an idea all the way to deployment.
- and also **Better security / performance / reliability / scalability**
